# Flip-Fluids-Compiler
A fairly straightforward and somewhat poopy compiler for the flip fluids that utilizes the power of Github Actions Workflows to compile for Windows binaries. 

The repo will check whenever the main branch of flip fluids gets a Version X.Y.Z. update and then compile a ready to use addon.

> I guess this could be useful for people who don't know how to use CMake nor never touched any compilers or afraid of the command line (i know it's scary stuff)

# How to use
- Simply go to releases tab [HERE](https://github.com/GhostYiL/Flip-Fluids-Compiler/releases/latest) and download the latest available 
- Add it as your regular addon
- PROFIT!

# To Do's:
- [x] Make CMake Action for the Flip Fluids
- [x] Fix release versioning with the main branch
- [x] Make release checker of the main branch
